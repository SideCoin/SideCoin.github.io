## **Who am I?**

I am third year at the University of California, San Diego. I'm currently studying **Cognitive Science** with a focus on machine learning. Despite my major being a research based major, I still have an interest software and hardware development. In particular, some of my [interests](#interests) are:
- making cool inventions
- reading
- playing video games

## **Current Goals**
- [x] Finish high school 
- [x] Get into college
- [ ] Survive college
- [ ] Get internships
- [ ] Get a job 
## **How do I Code?**

Process of coding:
1. Think about naive solution
   - Drawing, trying to visualize solution
2. Figure out what functions I will need
   - GOOGLE?
3. Improve solution

Through my experience, I learned that the rubber ducky method is the best way of coming up with ideas as well as solving problems. In short, grab a rubber ducky or whatever object that's on your desk and talk to it. Go over ideas, problems, or whatever. 

Google is definitely one of my best friends. Whenever I have an idea for a function I'll try googling to find an existing function. I try my best to understand how exactly the existing function works before I use it. This helps me have control over my program as well as satsify curiosity.

When I'm writing code, I try to comment things that may not be intuitive to another person or help organize my code. 

Example:
```
/**
 * Implements the PriorityQueue methods using Heap as its basic structure.
 * @param <K> - the key for the entry
 * @param <V> - value of the entry
 * Instance Variables:
 * CHILD_MULTI - value that when multi with parent index will give child index
 * PARENT_DIVIDE - value that when used to divide will get parent index
 * entries - the list of elements of the heap
 * comparator - the comparison style that will determine min/map heap 
 */
public class Heap<K, V> implements PriorityQueue<K, V> {
    private static final int CHILD_MULTI = 2; 
    private static final int PARENT_DIVIDE = 2; 
```

### **Book Review:**

A recent book that I've read is [*The Second Coming of Gluttony*](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-second-coming-of-gluttony). I'll give the book a solid **8 out of 10**. The greatest strength of this book is that the plot never loses itself. There's an obvious final goal for our MC(main character) as well as apparent difficulties. The MC is in a constant struggle between the freedom of choice, as well as its responsibility. It definitely felt great to see the MC grow and overcome his faults. 

One of my favorite quotes from the story:
> "There wasn’t anyone in this world without a story.
The difference was between someone who didn’t try to learn about others’ circumstances and someone who did."
